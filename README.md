### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a Software Engineer on the Infrastructure team at [Chime](https://github.com/chime). My work primarily involves building and maintaining highly available and scalable systems using AWS, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Datadog, and Terraform.

I mainly code in Python and Bash, with some experience in Ruby and Go.

I've also shared insights on Chime's engineering blog:
